Be Kind To Your Server$Introducing: the waiter rule “How others treat the CEO says nothing, they say. But how others treat the waiter is like a magical window into the soul.” - Del Jones Have you ever heard of "The Waiter Rule"? Basically it says that the way someone treats the wait staff at a restaurant shows how they often feel about, and treat, those who are perceived to be of a lower status. On the other hand, those who are kind, considerate and appreciative of their wait staff are often happier and more successful in their lives. Make a little effort to make eye contact with the person serving you. Smile. Ask how they are doing. They are often dealing with many things 'behind the scenes' both personally and in their job that the customer never knows about. Be compassionate if your food doesn't come out as quickly as you'd like. Sometimes that's because they are short-staffed or the cooks are backed up in the kitchen. And, make sure to tip your server (where geographically appropriate). They live on those tips! $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/882-be-kind-to-your-server
Compliment Drivers on How Well They Parked$See a car that’s parked inside the lines? Show the driver some love. Parking seems to be a difficult thing. Big trucks park in spots designated for small cars. People take up two spots instead of one. And sometimes parallel parkers get so close to your car that you have to pull an Austin Powers to get out. Recognize the exemplary parkers of the world and leave a kind note on their windshield, “Hey wow, you parked your car like a pro. High Five!” $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/863-compliment-drivers-on-how-well-they-parked
Plant A Tree$Make a difference in your environment and life! There are so many advantages to having more trees in your world! Most of you may know that trees improve air quality by producing oxygen. But what you might not know is they moderate the effects of sun and wind, and they clean the air by trapping dust, pollen and other pollutants. Do it in your yard to add some shade or maybe even increase your property value.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/958-plant-a-tree
Reply To A Post You Enjoy$We all get in the habit of breezing past content on social media, though it’s actually worth the effort of making the Internet a positive and constructive place.  Even if it’s just a simple “thank you” or tidbit of good feedback, the person behind the post will appreciate your time and effort. Take an extra moment to show you are grateful for the inspiration, information and/or humor they provide in your life. If you get value out of something, let it be known! Simple as that.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/1006-reply-to-a-post-you-enjoy

Knit Something$Knit One, Purl One, Give One Are you a crafty bugger? And super kind? Well, then... you should combine those two awesome things and make cool stuff for those in need! Knitters and crocheters are well-known for making things for other people. Why not use up some of your leftover yarn to create a warm hat, scarf or a pair of mittens for someone in need? Some cities even encourage you to tag a scarf with a note and tie it around a tree for the homeless letting them know that they can take it if they're cold. Another idea is to create tiny hats for newborns in the NICU. Hospitals often have a 'hat tree' or something similar where nurses or new parents can choose a beautiful hand-knit cap for their little one.

Clean Gym Equipment$It seems like common sense, but not everyone is aware of 'gym etiquette'. Grab a clean towel and take it along as you move from one machine or piece of equipment to the next. Wipe down where you touched the equipment, even if you don't feel 'sweaty'. Gym equipment can be covered in bacteria from multiple people using it all day long. The kind thing to do is make sure you wipe it down with a towel, or better yet, an antibacterial wipe (many gyms offer these near the machines and weights). You'll feel better and so will the other folks around you! $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/874-clean-gym-equipment

Respect Wildlife$ When you are out in nature, you are imposing on the natural habitat of many species. Be sure to be respectful of all the wild animals you see by observing at a distance, not feeding them, and leaving no trace.  Not only can you put yourself in danger by approaching wildlife, but it could negatively impact the animal as well. You never know if a wild animal has medical issues or possibly even rabies. Plus, loud, unfamiliar noises can stress out an animal, which can cause them to flee from their home. Remember you are a visitor: secure your food, pack in/pack out, and enjoy the natural beauty of wildlife from afar.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/1008-respect-wildlife

Adopt, Don't Shop$If you are considering bringing a new pet into your home, there are countless animals waiting for a family to love them.  Animal shelters and rescue groups are filled with happy, loving pets. Whereas many of the puppies sold in pet stores were born in puppy mills, where the conditions can be so bad that they often result in health problems for the animal. Erase the stigma that rescue pets can be antisocial or aggressive! Most of these pets wound up homeless because of a move or divorce, not because they did anything wrong, and are typically house-trained. Bringing a new pet is a huge decision and not one that should be done impulsively. But if this is something you’ve wanted for awhile, check out the shelters and change a life.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/984-adopt-dont-shop
Pick Up Trash Around Town$Garbage isn’t meant for the streets, do your part for your city and community by picking up pieces of trash every now and again.  One time, I was picking up trash in the park when a woman walking her dog asked me what I was doing. I told her it was such a beautiful park and a shame to see trash lying around. All she said was, “Well, isn’t that sweet!” and we went our separate ways. Though, when I turned back to grab my bike, I noticed that she started picking up trash and putting it in her dog’s waste bags. Kindness is truly contagious, so lead by example and others will follow.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/995-pick-up-trash-around-town

Take a Walk Outside$Day or night, rain or shine, walking can always improve your mood.  Researchers at the University of Michigan conducted a study that proved taking group nature walks resulted in several mental health benefits: decreased stress, depression and anxiety, as well as an improved sense of well-being. So if you don’t believe us, take it from science: going outside will make you feel better. It’s free, invigorating and the most underutilized stress-buster of all time. Walking has also triggered a creative boost in thinking for many people; cure your mental block by walking it off.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/997-take-a-walk-outside
Leave A Surprise In A Library Book$Kindness sneak attack! Here’s a great RAK if you’re shy or looking to surprise someone with your same taste in literature.

Be a Welcoming Neighbor$Howdy neighbor! It's can be hard to be the "new kid on the block" no matter how old we are so why not be proactive in welcoming a new neighbor? Get permission from your existing neighbors to add them to a contact list with names, address and contact information. Bring that to your new neighbor along with a homemade lasagna or cupcakes! If you aren't a chef, think about a bottle of wine or get creative with a packet of seeds and some gardening gloves. Just make sure they know that you're happy to have them in the neighborhood by introducing yourself and letting them know you're only a few steps away. $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/872-be-a-welcoming-neighbor
Donate Used Towels or Blankets to a Shelter$Animal shelters are always in need of supplies. Help out by clearing out storage boxes filled with old towels and blankets. Go above and beyond by donating toys and/or food as well. A popular kindness idea we’ve seen is asking for donations from friends in lieu of birthday or other presents. It’s a great way to get others involved and spread kindness in your life.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/983-donate-used-towels-or-blankets-to-a-shelter
Be Polite On The Road$Driving can be pretty fun if you're in the right state of mind. It can be a mini vacation where you can relax, listen to music or the news, enjoy the scenery and do some thinking. One of the best ways to enjoy your drive is to be polite to others on the road who may be stressed out, lost or late for an appointment. Let them merge. Share a smile or a friendly wave if they let you in. Use your turn signal and don't get frustrated when others don't. Let pedestrians cross the road and follow the speed limit signs.  Honestly, when you are friendly and polite to others while driving, it makes it so much more pleasant (for everyone) to be on the road! $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/873-be-polite-on-the-road
Bake Someone A Cake$Mmmmm.. cake. We've never known a person who isn't happy to see cake! (Well, except those who might have an allergy or those who prefer pie.) Baking is a great way to take some "me time" or bond with a child or family member. And, at the end of the process you'll have a beautiful treat to share with someone who might need a little cheering up! There are about a thousand reasons to bake a cake... forget the birthday and bake a cake for a made up holiday like "You're Awesome Day!"   $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/871-bake-someone-a-cake
Complain Less$Being positive in a negative situation makes you a leader Sometimes it's easy to focus on the things that are bringing us down and making life difficult. But, science shows that when we spend even a small amount of time focusing on the things for which we're grateful, our lives are much better. We start seeing things in a more positive light and find fewer things to complain about.  It can be as easy as starting your day by thinking of one thing for which you're grateful! There are even mobile apps which remind you during the day to take a moment to be grateful for something. Make it a point to take a deep breath and think of something that makes you happy before you complain. You'll find you feel better. $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/875-complain-less
Leave a surprise in your mailbox for your mail carrier$It could be anything from treats to an approved gift certificate to a simple note that says, “thank you!” Imagine doing the job of your mail carrier—delivering an endless stream of letters, bills, magazines, and advertisements. Navigating traffic, mean dogs, the hot sun in the summer and cold rains or snow in the winter with tenacity and grit. No matter the obstacles, our mail carriers are out there delivering our mail day in and day out. Wouldn't it be nice to leave something for them in your mailbox to say thanks? It doesn’t have to be expensive—a quick note that simply says 'thanks for delivering our mail each day!' would be very appreciated. You could also leave a treat or an icy cold bottle of water on a hot day. (Maybe freeze the night before and leave it with a note. If you time it right, it will be the perfect bottle of slushy ice water by the time your mail carrier arrives). If you're feeling extra generous, the U.S. Government Accountability Office says that your mail carrier is allowed to accept gifts of up to $20 in value (but not cash). This includes gift cards that are from a company like Amazon or your favorite restaurant. Imagine how good your mail carrier would feel to get something fun like that! Thanks for Vicki for helping us refine this kindness idea! $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/974-leave-a-surprise-in-your-mailbox-for-your-mail-carrier
Run / Walk A 5K For A Cause $It’s such a great feeling to combine doing something good for yourself and others - help out a charity in need through exercise.  There’s a lot of opportunities to run or walk for charity. To find a fur-friendly 5K, for animals, check out your local Humane Society or other nonprofit focused on animal conservation. The money raised goes towards helping homeless animals receive the care they need: including food, shelter, vet bills and more. You could also participate in a race for medical issues, such as Susan G. Komen’s Race For The Cure and the JDRF Walk To Cure Diabetes. To learn more about 5K races you can do for charity, check out this list compiled by LiveStrong.  $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/1001-run-walk-a-5k-for-a-cause
Laugh Often$Start telling jokes, watching cat videos on YouTube, or whatever makes you laugh! Laughter should be listed as a super food. We know, it's not a food, but it's got the same number of benefits as all the super foods combined!  It is SO GOOD for your health. Check out this list of health benefits: 1. Laughing relaxes your whole body. (well, once you're done laughing...because, we've all laughed so hard it hurts) 2. Laughter relieves physical tension and stress.  3. A good belly laugh can boost your immune system. It decreases your stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies. What?? Amazing. 4. When we laugh, we release endorphins. You know what those are, right? They are the 'feel good' chemicals our body produces when we...well.. feel good. 5. Laughing improves blood flow, thus protecting yoru heart from heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.  6. You burn calories while you're laughing. If you laugh 10-15 minutes a day, you can burn about 40 calories. That's enough to lose a few pounds over the course of a year! 7. Laughing helps us live longer. Seriously, a study in Norway showed that people with a strong sense of humor outlived those who didn't laugh as often. We're moving to Norway. $https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas/889-laugh-often
