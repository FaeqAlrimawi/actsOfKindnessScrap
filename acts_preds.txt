                      Gifts in the distance This year, because of the coronavirus, we celebrated easter at home. We did a family video reunion and we had planty of chocolate, but it seemed like it wasnâ€™t enough. I remembered all the easters of my life and I saw that each year we gave and not just received. So I had an idea, I started to draw with my sister and my brothers. Finally, we send our drawings and everybody was happy.   I hope you will do the same for your family wathever appends.                                                                                                                   $no
                  Once my family and I went looking for a house to move to.  I had a wrestling meet that day so we might not be there in time to look at the house.  We made it there ten minutes before the open house was over  then it was past the time for it to close so then we were saying bye and thank you to the person there then she said you  can keep looking if we wanted and she also said that she would no kick us out.we looked for another half hour .. $no

          I was on my way to get dinner with my family and when we  got there my family  walked in but I saw a bunch of people about to come in so I held the door until they came and it made me feel really good. They said thank you and so I went back with my family and I told then how I held the door for a group of people they were proud of me and said "good job!" I recommend doing something kind today like holding the door for someone, saying they look nice even smiling will spread kindness. $no
        I find it very sad, and frustrating, that humans are ridding themselves of humanity! I mean.... think of it this way, Earth is our home, our PLANET, it's all we have, whether it was made by God or not. People have different beliefs, everyone does and I respect that, I do. People believe Earth was created different ways and people believe in Jesus and some people just don't. That's fine, everyone is different, but... it's the same planet, it's our home no matter how it was made or who was here first. Earth is everything we have. It is our food, our shelter, our water, our friends, our family, our air and our wildlife. Earth provides us with much more things and people and life than I could list, but those are some of the major ones. Some people understand this and they respect our planet and other people just don't care. Humans are greedy, naturally and genetically we all our, but...that changed! People stepped out of their genes and they became their own person! They stood up for Earth and they made a difference, but that changed too. Earth, like I said is all we have, everything we have and we should respect it, take care of it and most of all LOVE IT! I know, it's kind of stupid to say LOVE IT, but think about it. We should. Now... now, people hunt animals and kill them and eat them and they litter and do things that are so heartbreaking and infuriating! The oceans provide us with tons of oxygen, almost half of all our oxygen comes from the ocean and if we kill our oceans, we don't get any oxygen from the oceans anymore! We have to rely on the trees and healthy plants. People don't think! They think well, okay, I don't care if the oceans die, we have thousands of trees, big deal. It's a heck of a big deal! If we kill our beautiful seas and deforestation rids the planet of all our stunning trees, what do we have left? Now, come on, this is easy. Nothing. That's the answer, nothing. We won't have marine ecosystems, many animals on land that rely on trees and plants for food and homes die, and most of all.... our oxygen supply is cut down to zero! No more oxygen, no more plants, trees or ocean wildlife, no more humanity or life. It's really horrific and such a HUGE eye opener, seriously. It makes you just... think, if only for a second before pushing it aside. You comprehend it, just... when your mind finally circles back to the problems and what's going on, it's too late. It's terrible! I want everyone who reads this, if it's only a couple of people to think about the oceans we have as our family. Just for a second. Our oceans and our marine wildlife is our family, it's true. The graceful dolphins that swim just under the surface of the clear water, grazing the waves at an imperceptible speed and stillness. The sharks that are so misunderstood, with their beautiful fins slicing through the water and their silence that makes everything stop. The whales that are bigger than life with the mouths of true gentle giants and fins that are huge and destructive, but graceful and well controlled. The coral reefs that create oxygen for us to breathe, helping us out when we just destroy them with their beautiful marine flowers that is shelter for hundreds of tiny shrimp and fish species as well as other curious creatures just wandering around the sea floor, happy to be alive, if alive at all. The microscopic creatures floating in follicles invisible in the stunning water, creating things and other creatures that make all humans wonder and ponder what is actually happening. The water itself, pristine, giving a home to millions and millions of interesting species with some names no one can pronounce without their I phone. All that is our family, our long lost relatives, our best friends. The ocean and marine life has always been my best friend, If I have to be honest here. I don't have many friends. I have a few, but they don't live in the same state as me and all I can do is pray that their flight here isn't blocked or canceled every summer. Marine life and the Ocean has always been there. I swim in the ocean no matter how cold outside, having fun on my boogie board and appreciating some places in the water isn't crowded with dirt and trash and foam. I sit on the beach no matter how hot it is, sifting through the sand and looking out at the water, studying everything precariously, so not to miss anything, so that mentally I can know what I need to. I go online a lot and read about the oceans and marine life and marine conservation and I spend hours watching documentaries on TV, taking notes and watching with wonder and happiness and horror and disgust in my heart and my eyes. Mainly, I like being there.... on the beach, mainly in the water, with all my family and friends. I have family and some friends, I'm not a solitary person or anything, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just I'm not. I have all those people behind me, but not many friends. Not any BEST friends. The ocean is a comfort. It is there, always. I am scared for my great, great grandchildren, or even my own children if the oceans will be there. The seas will be THERE, but not the same. They will be trashed and the marine life won't be... alive. That makes me very worried because it seems like everything get's worse as the years pass. Not better. It needs to get better. My family needs my help and I will do everything I can. As I get older and can go places and speak up more, I will do more and I will make more of a change. I will help, no matter what. Everyone can make a change. I have Instagram and Twitter and I'm almost positive you do too, anyone, everyone. Earth is our family, not just the oceans. EARTH, OUR FAMILY! Our planet. Our home, needs our help. It's dying and deteriorating and the oceans are getting acidic and the lands are being deforested and everyone just get's more and more greedy, oblivious to what DAMAGE they are causing. I have had people ask me, to test me on what I know, what is causing all this damage and destruction? I don't want to act like a know-it-all, but I do like having a meaningful word. I told those people that it's not what, who. Who then? Who's making Earth suffer? "Who's" not right either, is it? Nope. More like..... us. Humans. Us. The oceans are our family, let's protect and save our loved ones. $yes

     It is amazing that every act we take will ultimately affect other people around us, and this proves the significant effects in changing other peopleâ€™s behaviors through imitation (copying a particular behavior we observe). When we give to others, we are taking consideration for other peopleâ€™s desires and needs rather than our own. There are actually many benefits in giving, and this has proven for physical, mental, and emotional relief. As someone with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the world can seem to be a confusing and cruel place. Having ASD shows the difficulty in properly socializing with other people and making and maintaining relationships. I have been judged and criticized for something beyond my control, and being excluded from social interactions by many children was painful enough to know that I was not wanted. However, one act of kindness from someone without them knowing about my disorder can go a long way and make me better as a person. Throughout my life, I have learned a few concepts on how important giving really is. First, people who give more to others are genuinely happier than those who do not. Giving is not just materialistic. It is the emotional support and motivation to keep on being the person that I am, and being given emotional support shows more lasting effects. Thinking about others has a longer effect in staying joyful with your life, and nothing is as satisfying as giving to people who need it most. When I saw those who did nice things for me and started imitating them, it reinforced me to keep on doing nice things for others, even if they may acknowledge that or not.  Also, giving to others makes you â€œfeel-good [and] do-good,â€ and helping everyone around us is truly satisfying. I see that every person wants nice things to be done to them, and this is especially true for me with the encouragement that I need to keep living my life with autism. Every day, we all go through personal battles and struggles that having the right motivation from people is virtual for our personal growth.        Feeling good in doing good for others also shows that you have concerns for them and puts you in a more peaceful state. I currently volunteer in a local public school assisting a special education teacher with students with autism. Having to help someone learn more about autism through my own experience is one of the best things I have done to help those who are in need of assistance, no matter how great or small. Volunteering there truly has opened new discoveries and inspirations.  As of now, I can never stop giving back to people, even to those who don't do anything for me.  The way that I can see how people treat others really speaks louder than any words they express, and this is something that I am willing to hold onto. There is nothing that people can do to take away the fact that still doing good for others without it being reciprocated to us is actually the strongest trait a person can have. We all need to remember that the way we respond and approach those situations can do so much more than what we ought to think. Responding with respect and positivity flourishes our character and strengthens our potentials. Giving your life to help someone else is truly the highest act of kindness anyone can show, and I am speaking that through the experiences I have and the choices I made. We do not have to necessarily give much to lend a hand, but it just needs an open mind and heart. Becoming empathetic helps us think deeper about the world we live in and what people go through in their daily basis. Giving will simply make a big difference in the world that is desperately in need of help. *Inspired from the blog "The Benefits in Giving to Others" in my website What A Beautiful Real Life  $yes
     My daughter (5) and I went around our community lake and participated in a chalk-your-walk challenge. I wrote messages of hope, encouragement, and love while she drew pictures of flowers, hearts, and cat/unicorn-cat heads. We chalked up random spots around the lake path, which is a .8-mile loop. We worked all day with our art and was pleasantly surprised when we got back to the first picture set at how well the messages had held up. People were taking care to walk around the artwork, very few treaded over the work and most of those were oblivious to it being there.       At one point we sat down in the shade under a group of trees and watched the people who were out walking, biking, or jogging. Many turned their heads as they walked by, glancing at the message. A few stopped to look at, read, and comment on/talk about what was written. The best reactions we got were from the ones that stopped to take pictures of the art and messages. One lady approached us and was gushing about how happy it made her feel to see the words of kindness and hope written out on the sidewalk. She told us that she was going to post her favorite message on her Instagram and share it with her followers. We talked with her but never told her it was us that drew them.       The best moments were watching how happy people were just reading the messages and watching the art spark conversations with smiles. I also loved the care that people took to protect the art by running, walking, and biking around each one to help them last. At one site, someone had moved a rock to either side of the work to alert others. I loved sharing this moment with my daughter and seeing how happy she would get when someone commented on her cats.  $no

   I was going to eat out one night with my friends, but when I arrived, I realized I had forgotten money. As all of my friends began ordering food, I stood there awkwardly, until a woman I hardly even know, realizing my predicament, walked over and bought me an entire meal and paid for it all. It's a real joy to know that there are still some good people out there, even if they seem to be hiding. It really inspired me and helped me to realize that simple acts of kindness like these ARE appreciated.  $no

 Before I began my 8th grade community service project, I thought about what community service is.  I realized that it depends on how you define community.  I relate community mostly to the community that I am around everyday, my school. Since I can remember, community service has been a part of my familyâ€™s values and a guiding principle of the school I attend.  I have attended the same school for over ten years, a school that has grown to 12 acres, with an expansive organic garden, a pond and farm animals.  I am the second from the youngest in my family, and our family has been a part of this Waldorf community for 17 years. We have built buildings and planted gardens and cared for animals. We cheerfully volunteered to work weekends and evenings at the school regularly. Beauty and service has always been a part of our community work at Desert Marigold School.  When I was a younger child, gnomes and fairies on the campus performed random acts of kindness and beauty; and beautiful festivals and performances celebrated all that was good in the natural world such as the changing of the seasons, holidays, and friendship. We accepted this as an absolute truth â€“ and believed that this was the way that the world really is â€“ A world of beauty and kindness.  As we got older, we became more aware of the communities beyond our campus gardens and gentle curriculum.  We found out that the world is not always a place where kindness and beauty are an everyday expectation.  I also started to notice that our little school community had grown. There was so much to do on the campus, new people joined our community who did not have the benefit of experiencing what I did.  They did not know the tricky gnomes whose mischievous deeds  needed fixing or cleaning up; or spirited fairies that magically transformed little spaces into beautiful nature tables and natural works of art. It seemed that there were not enough volunteers or staff to get everything done, there is just too much to do.  Many things do not seem as beautiful now that I am older.  I guess I am more jaded in my perceptions, as the magic of fairies and gnomes have faded somewhat from my sight â€“ although I can still occasionally see glimmers of it in the kindergarten yard. My older sister also had a similar view to mine.  She wanted to do something to help make the campus more beautiful too. We came up with a plan; to anonymously make the community more beautiful through random acts of community kindness and beauty.  That is when I decided that my community service project would be in service to beautifying the school, in functional ways, and hopefully appease the few remaining fairies and gnomes and other elemental beings that may still reside at our school.  We selected two campus projects, that we worked on together.   We designed the projects and got permission from the administration to do them.  We painted the boyâ€™s and girlâ€™s bathrooms on the lower grades yard first.  We used the celestial sun and moon representation on the doors, artfully designed by my sister.  I selected a third project to beautify the campus and to bring imagination and magic near the early childhood yard.  A tree near the entrance of the early childhood yard was sick and needed to be cut down.  The young children were upset by the loss of this tree, and the stump left was a sad reminder to them of the living tree that stood at the entrance to their yard.  I decided to convert this tree stump into a planter and fairy house, for visiting fairies to stop by and have a little snack.  I put little windows in the bark fairy house so that the children can peek in to the little  kitchen as they walk by.  These are little things, even though hand chiseling the tree stump took many hours, it was well worth the evenings and weekend time to beautify parts of the campus and heal a wound in our natural environment at our school.  I hope my story inspires other potential RAKtivists to consider doing random acts of kindness and beauty at their school.  $yes

 I was recently looking on Random Acts of Kindness's Facebook page, and I found the coolest thing... Sneaky Cards! I loved the idea of spreading kindness, after all I am a RAKtivist!     The next day, my mom and I went to Kohl's and got them! I shuffled the deck and  pulled out a card. It said to try a new food! My mom said she would cook macaroni salad!    The suspense was in, I tried it..., and it tasted great! I loved all the ingredients in the Macaroni salad! I was amazed! The next day we went to Putt-Putt Funhouse, because the card said after you try it, give this card to someone near you! Because my family didn't want it, I hid it at  Putt Putt!   To all my fellow RAKTVISTS out there, be as kind as you can today and peace out! $no

(This story was written by a student at our school for our Random Acts of Kindness week.) "I am sensitive and helpful, but sometimes I can be not so attentive to everything. For instance, I donâ€™t notice that I perform kind acts for my friends, relatives, and even strangers. However, I realize that I share kindness everywhere when people need it. What is my secret? I donâ€™t make myÂ actions public. My kindness is in the details; I do small things for everyone. If I use a coffee mug in cafes, I wash it when I'm done. If I see a stranger needs coins for the cashier, I give them to him. If I hear some doors in my school are squeaking, I oil them. You would reply: â€œMany people use this method. Why do you think itâ€™s very unique?â€ Yes, I agree. This a method of acting kindly that millions of people use. You may not realize it, but little by little you begin to change your mindset to looking to help others more often. Look at family, friends, and citizens in your city. Someone directly wants or needs the help of others. Then make a choice to help the person or not." $no
(This story was written to the Random Acts of Kindness Day by one of my pupils, Andrew.) "As for me, kindness is an integral part of our life. It fills our lives with warmth, joy, and other positive feelings. Therefore, we have to be kind to each other and share our kindness stories. I would like to share my story with you. Once, my brother and I were riding bikes when we suddenly noticed a dog falling into a pit. It could not get out of there, so we decided to help. First of all, we called up a few emergency services. But they all answered that they were not able to help us. Then we started trying to pull the dog on our own. The first time it failed, because I could not get into the pit to reach the dog. Then my brother started to do this. He was smaller than me, so he managed to climb to the pit and raise the dog as high as he could. Then I took the dog and pulled it to the surface, and then pulled out my brother from the pit. It turned out that the dog was blind, and therefore, probably, did not notice the pit and fell. We took it to a safe place and went home. We were happy to help the dog." $no

2 days ago I saw this lady who looked so cold and I felt really bad she was outside of the store called Walmart and I went in the store and bought her a blanket. Some people ask me why did I do that, and I thought to myself and said, "Well if that lady was me I would also want somebody to do something kind for me."  That's my kindness story -Unknown $no
2020 was a very difficult year for all of us for relatively obvious reasons. COVID-19 happened, we were forced to stay in our homes, isolated from people other than possibly our families, (for some of us), and even when we did go out, we had to social distance with masks. As for me, both 2020 and 2021 were very hard. COVID-19, my dad had 2 major surgeries, my dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, my parents got COVID-19 my last week of 8th grade so I couldn't go anywhere except graduation, (because I have kind and understanding teachers and friends), and my mom even got COVID pneumonia in both lungs. Those are only a few examples, however, especially in those difficult times, I felt it very important to be kind. It made me feel better, and took my mind off the bad things in life. I love being able to make a difference, even if it's just a small difference in someone's day. So please remember 2 things: 1, being kind can benefit even more than the person you're being kind to. And 2, no matter what you're going through, being kind doesn't take much for you, but it can change a person's life, even yours! Just a smile can go a long way. $no

A couple of days ago, I was taking a walk and I saw lots of people, so I decided to start saying 'hello' to them. I also wished them a nice day. It is funny to see when we say 'hello' to people, that makes them so happy and always brings a smile on their face. I feel very proud doing it and cannot wait to do it again today. Try it yourself, it is free!!! Gaby $no
A couple of years ago, I was introduced to a wonderfully great initiative called â€œRandom Act of Kindness Weekâ€. The name speaks for itself; itâ€™s a call to action to show kindness, in some capacity, for 7 days. There is a foundation in Denver that spearheads this directive. Its charge is to take this week to step out of your normal routine or comfort zone and attempt a new random act of kindness each day of the celebratory week. I thought it was profoundÂ soÂ I wrote a blog post about it in 2012. I wanted to inspire others to embrace this endeavor. I encouraged people to do something nice for a stranger, make a new friend, and give sincere compliments to everyone. The only problem? I didnâ€™t walk the walk. I may have thrown around an extra compliment or two, smiled a little more or told a buddy how much I valued his friendship, but I can honestly say that I was sitting firmly on the sidelines. Thatâ€™s why I added number 52 to my new life list: â€œActively Participate in Random Act of Kindness Week.â€ I looked up the dates for 2014, marked it on my calendar, and completely forgot about it. On February 10, I received a reminder notification on my phone that said simply, â€œHappy RAK Week!â€ It was here, and I was unprepared. That sounds kind of strange, huh? Unprepared to show kindness? Yep! Guilty! I was at a complete loss about what to do. At one point, I even asked myself, â€œWhat IS kindness?â€ You would have thought that someone told me that C-A-T now spelled dog. I sat at my desk, stared at the floor, and hoped for all the answers to magically appear. I sat there for a long time. No magic. I re-read my 2012 blog post, but the calls to action were so vague. I became even more confused. Then, I prayed: â€œHeavenly Fatherâ€¦I donâ€™t mean to be an idiot, but I need you to open my heart and educate me about kindness. Show me how you want to use me this week.â€ I looked up from the floorÂ and heard a profound whisper: â€œHow do you experience kindness? What has to happened in your life to feel kindness from another person?â€ Then the whisper turned into a loud, stern command: â€œStart. There.â€ So, I did. I put together a 7-day plan of attack and executed it: MONDAY: Reach out to someone who positively impacted your professional career; express your appreciation on how they influenced your life. My RAK: I sent e-mails to two men who gave me a chance to live out my dream of â€œcoachingâ€ college football. Everett Todd hired me as a volunteer coach at Blinn College in 2001Â and Mike Sinquefield hired me as recruiting coordinator at TCU 3 years later. I told both of them: â€œI know it might sound a little weird, but I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today without YOU! Thank you!â€Â  TUESDAY: Let someone know that theyâ€™re in your prayers. My RAK: I reached out to a high school buddy and his wife. Their 4-year-old son, Jackson, is in a backyard brawl with Leukemia. Iâ€™ve been receiving his updates on Facebook, and Iâ€™ve been inspired by his strength and courage. I wanted his parents to know that prayers were coming their way. I also shared a wonderfully great story of another family friend whose granddaughter stood toe-to-toe with cancer and whipped its butt. I told them that I thought it was important that they heard stories like that. WEDNESDAY: Do something for a complete stranger. My RAK: I bought groceries for a random person. Confession: I strategically picked this personÂ because her basket was pretty light. I wanted to do something nice and unexpected for someone without taking out a loan. So I purchased some milk, creamer, bananas, a Valentineâ€™s card, and some other things. I told the woman,Â â€œIâ€™d like to buy your groceries today.â€ She responded, â€œIâ€™ve heard of this. Pay it forward, right?â€ I handed her one of my "Live the List" business cards. On the back, I had actually written â€œPay. It. Forward.â€ I also wished her a happy Random Act of Kindness Week.Â She was very appreciative and she promised that she would pay it forward.Â  THURSDAY: Let your family know how much you care. My RAK: I sent flowers to my sisters with a simple note, expressing how much I loved them. They are such amazing sisters. I told them that I donâ€™t tell them that enough. FRIDAY (Valentineâ€™s Day): Do something nice for your spouse. My RAK: I played hooky from work and gave my wife an entire day to herself. She could do anything she wanted to doÂ while I held down the fort with the kiddos. I try to give her a couple hours during the week for a â€œMommy Day Out,â€ but life sometimes throws a wrench into our plan. She wrote a Facebook message: â€œThere were no roses delivered to me today, no sparkling jewelry, and no crazy stuffed animals, but I got the best Valentine's Day gift I could ever receive. My honey took off work today, took the kids, and gave me a full day to myself!! Can I say I have the most AMAZING hubby ever?! So I grabbed my yoga mat, a good read, and my breast pump! Ha! Sorry if thatâ€™s TMI (shrug) but a babyâ€™s gotta eat!Â And headed out! Feeling refreshed!â€ SATURDAY: Embrace the power of presence. My RAK: My mom has a 90-year-old cousin who lives in Glen Rose. I spent a little over an hour with her on Saturday morning, discussing local politics and family history. She is sharp, funny, and opinionated, which areÂ all of the things that I miss in my two grandmothers. As I was leaving, we decided it would be nice to do it again soon. She promised to remember to offer me coffee next time. SUNDAY: Express gratefulness to your parents. My RAK: I simply wrote my parents a thank you noteÂ expressing my appreciation for them being the greatest parents and grandparentsÂ in the world. I closed my note by writing, â€œI love you guys so much. I never want you to question my gratefulness.â€ Confession: I had a hard time writing this post. The last thing that I wanted to do was scream: â€œIâ€™m. So. Awesome. Look. At. Me.â€ That definitely wasnâ€™t the point, so I kept asking myself, â€œWhy are you sharing all of this?â€ I never came up with a good answer. I just kept writing. Then it hit me. Maybe â€“ just maybe â€“ one of my random acts of kindness will inspire someone else. Maybe they will reach out to a person who inspired them and say thank you, tell their siblings how much they love them and/or express their gratitude to their folks. I realized throughout this process that I donâ€™t do this enough. For some tragic reason, it is out of my â€œnormal routineâ€ and outside my â€œcomfort zoneâ€. For me to show kindness WAS random. Again, when I added #52 to my current life list, I wasnâ€™t sure why I was doing it. I do now. This endeavor made me realize that itâ€™s not that difficult to step out of the spotlight and put the emphasis on others. Thatâ€™s all kindness is: putting others before yourself. After 7 days of executing my plan of attack, I made a vow to myself to remove the â€œrandomnessâ€ from my acts of kindness. I promised myself to be more intentional about it. Thatâ€™s my charge to YOU: Be intentional about showing kindness. Again, itâ€™s not difficult. It can be a note, e-mail, or letter. It can be a kind word or smile. It can be a helping hand. It can be 5 minutes of your undivided attention. How do you accomplish this? Just start! Do something kind for another person RIGHT NOW! I promise it will completely change your mindset and positively impact your day. Then what? Do it again tomorrow. $yes
A couple years ago, when I was having serious mental health struggles, my friend always tried his best to help me. He would listen to me when I needed it or simply distracted me from what was troubling me. He put aside a lot of his own personal issues to make sure I was okay and that means the world to me to this day. I try to make it up to him every day because the kindness he showed me during that time was life-changing. I'll always remember it! $no
A few days a go it was National Kindness Day it was a small thing I did but it made a little girl happy.

A few years ago when my kids were younger, we stopped at a local barbecue chicken place to buy some dinner. The kids were tired and grumpy. Â My youngest was adamant that she did NOT want chicken for dinner and fully refused to get out of the car. A man walked up and asked if Iâ€™d like a chicken he had just bought. He explained that his friend owned the shop and he had stopped to say hiÂ but felt weird not buying something. He already had dinner plans. I gratefully accepted! This RAK made me feel happy for days! $no
A few years ago, my husband and I started writing a series of childrens books called "Jett Around the World". The series is about a boy who travels to a different city in each book, with the intention of teaching kids about the world around them. What started as a business ideaÂ quickly evolvedÂ and the social worker in me urged us to do something bigger with the idea. We have now committed to donating 1,000 books to schools and kids in need when we reach our goal ofÂ sellingÂ 1,000 books. So far, we have donated 100 of our books to a school in Nairobi with very minimal supplies. We can't wait to hear from the kids there and see what we can do next. The opportunity to give back now seems endless. $no
A friend of a friend of mine is a single mother to two young children. Her son is autistic and requires a LOT of care, so she is unable to work. Every day, this woman goes without in order to take care of her children on minimal government funding. I found out that she has been living in severe pain because for the past three months, she has needed dental surgery that her government provided dental coverage won't pay for because it is classified as "cosmetic" (basically, they would only pay for it once it became so infected that she was going into septic shock). Without her knowledge, I acquired the funds necessary for her to get the surgery, and dropped them off to her in an envelope in her mailbox with a note that said, "angels are watching over you". She was able to get the surgery three days later and is now recovering at home. $no
A large number of people, including myself, volunteer to help cook and serve people every Thursday. These people are homeless, financially disadvantaged, or alone. Over 140 meals are served or given out, including a main meal and dessert. Takeaway meals are given to those who request or are in need. What l love about this program is how it involves the whole community. The students and people who volunteer bring clothing and shelf-stable food. People with disabilities come to serve. People who are elderly or have life-threatening illnesses serve others in need. Some of the volunteers are in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s. We all join together as a family and we love and support each other. Books and magazines are donated. Chemists donate supplies. Every person in attendance is able to take a bag of donated bread and rolls home each week. Hearing, dental, vaccinations, and medical checks are donated. People volunteer to pamper by giving manicures. Others volunteer to play music. The attendees are able to take showers and have their clothing washed. Supermarkets and other stores donate food. Bayside Church has a van to pick up all of the food and helps to fund the two locations. Once a week, we bond together and provideÂ the dignity and respect we all deserve. I'm so proud to have volunteered at Matt's Place over the past three years. For some, it is a lifeline and the first contact for shelter and other needed services. Most of all, people care and form a bond. Â Some people haven't eaten for days and are living on the streets; their whispered "thank you" is coupled with tears in their eyes and volunteers know they have made a difference. There is no greater gift than love. $no

A older woman was walking the cobble streets in Italy one morning, when she stumbled across a hairless cat in a box down a ally.  The woman had something in common with the cat because she was hairless from an old sickness.  The day was cold, and grey the little cat was shivering in his loose skin.  the old woman saw the pain, and hardship in the little green feline eyes.  Without a second thought the woman pulled of her furry coat and carefully traded her synthetic hair to the cat.  The woman opened her arms as too not frighten the cat, and the cat reluctantly curled into her lap meowing.  With care and a understanding stronger than words the woman wrapped the warm and heavy coat around the cats pink skin.  The woman sat there with the cat until nightfall and the little creature was sound asleep.  The two beings were both born into a life they could not change, but they used their hurt, and pain to bring joy and love to the others lives. $no

A student at my elementary was being harshly bullied every day at school. She thought there was nothing she could do about the teasing, name-calling, gossiping, and hundreds of notes with horrible messages on them. I reached out to her; she was an amazing girl, sweet, pretty, smart, and more. I saw no apparent reason for her to be put down so hard. It broke my heart that she had to deal with it, and I couldn't stand by and watch, as I had experienced my share of bullying myself. I didn't want anyone else to go through what I had. I promised her that I would help her. I gathered my entire class, wrote an appreciation card, and had everybody sign it. At recess, I had gathered multiple teachers and students for a rally against the bullies. The bullying stopped for good and she met and made multiple new friends. Our kindness inspired many people in the school to stop bullying, and for the rest of the year, we tried our hardest to be a bully-free school. $no
A week ago, I called up all the Scouts I could get and, with their leaders, we went to a home that was needing a lot of TLC outside. The family was losing their father toÂ an aggressive form of cancer. It took all of six months for this cancer to ravage this 33-year-old man's body. Because of his struggle, the appearance of the home simply wasn't a priority for them. We helped his wife clean the outside of her home and then I bought pizza for everyone. It was fun!!! $no
A woman at the gate for a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, on November 14 engaged my 9-month-old grandson at the airport. She was as enthralled with him as he was with her. When we got on the plane, she happened to be sitting right behind us and asked to hold him. He went into her arms like he had known her all his life. She held him the entire 45 minutes, gave him his bottle, and they both fell sound asleep until we landed. It gave us a much needed break, as we had a long day of travel, and was a most touching moment. She is African-American with â€˜funny hairâ€™ as she described herself and in about her mid 50â€™s. She said she used to be in the healthcare field and lives in Nashville. I would love to find her and let her know how special that moment was. Regina, I believe, was her name. I donâ€™t know where to look, so I started here with the story. $no
A year ago it dawned on me that social media platforms had taken a bad turn. Everywhere I looked, it was all just pictures of peopleâ€™s lunch, meaningless selfies, and depressing news. I realized that I was wasting so much time scrolling down countless feeds viewing content that served no purpose. It was unbearable! It wasnâ€™t until I came across my favorite quote, â€œDonâ€™t hate, create!â€ when something triggered in my mind. The world needs a new social platform to inspire positive change. I wanted to see a social network where users shared inspiring stories, genuine passions, and connectÂ with other organizations to help create positive change. This is how Boomcast was born. Fast forward a year later and my team of eight have created an iOS app that focuses on inspiring content and passionate users. One of the biggest blessings Iâ€™ve received recently was when a new random user told me that, â€œBoomcast has the potential to heal the world.â€ This gave me goosebumps. â€œHow exactly?â€ I asked. The user continued to say that when she downloaded Boomcast for the first time, she saw a quote which read, â€œIf you want to see a better change in this world, start changing your own perspective.â€ At the time, she just got out of hospital and was feeling incredibly sorry for herself. She saw this quoteÂ and it naturally made her feel great. She then shared joy with her husband, who went to work that day and projected his happiness on his colleagues. All of a sudden, a ripple effect formed! Itâ€™s with these small positivities and inspiring stories that create beautiful ripples that have potential to heal the world. Are you an individual or organization with an inspiring story and mission to share? If so, weâ€™d love to collaborate. Boomcast hopes to help heal the world one broadcast at a time.

â€œMrs. Willis, this is Mr. West from the school. Â Do you have a minute to talk?â€ Â Silence. â€œYes,â€ she finally replied quietly. â€œI just called to tell you that Natasha had a great day at school today.â€ Â More silence. â€œReally?â€ she questioned. So I went on. Â â€œI can tell that Natasha is really proud of her new coat.â€ Â Luxuries like new coats were a rarity in Natashaâ€™s household. Â Just keeping the utilities turned on and having food to eat was a constant challenge. Â Natashaâ€™s new coat had been provided through a holiday coat drive. Â  Natasha was a seventh grade, special needs student who often had emotional outbursts. Outbursts when asked to participate in class, outbursts when the prior night at home had been chaotic, and outbursts when facing several days away from school over a holiday break. Finally, I heard quiet sobbing at the other end of the phone. Â â€œThank you.â€ Â Silence again. Â â€œThank you, Mr. West. Not one person has ever called me from school with good news about Natasha. Â Not for any of my kids. Â Not once.â€ I felt sad. â€œMrs. Willis, Iâ€™m sorry I havenâ€™t made this call sooner, and Iâ€™m sorry no one else from school has ever made this call either. Sure, Natasha has some tough days, but she also has a lot of okay days. Â Heck, she has plenty of really good days too.â€ Â Â Over the next few minutes I talked about Natashaâ€™s infectious smile, about her great laugh, about how she responded so positively to compliments.Â  Mrs. Willis was truly grateful for the call. Â Â So was I. Â Over the next year and a half, I called Mrs. Willis several more times, sometimes to share positive reports and sometimes to discuss concerns. Some 23+ years and several career posts later, I still make it a priority to make those calls as often as possible. Â A lot has changed in education over 23 years, but parents still like to hear positive reports about their children, just as Mrs. Willis did that day. $no

About 6 years ago, I was on a plane next to a woman who was relentlessly energetic and fidgety. I was tired and wanted to take a nap. But before I could go into â€œignore mode,â€ she tapped me on the shoulder to introduce herself. â€œHi, my name is Helga!â€ We got to talking and eventually it came up that I had started an organization in high school called R.A.K.E. (Random Acts of Kindness, Etc.). As I described what we did, Helga got very serious and told me that she thought, â€œthere was nothing more important in the world than Kindness.â€ I was curious why she was so passionate and, as the plane took off, she dove into a story about the last time she had flown; it was 3 years past and she was en route to Arizona because she had gotten sudden news her Dadâ€™s health was on the decline. Just as the plane was about to depart to Phoenix, her fatherâ€™s physician called to inform her that her dad had rather suddenly passed away. For the 3 hour plane ride, she sat in stunned silence around strangers. When she arrived to the airport in Arizona, she walked to the nearest wall, sat down, and cried. And here is the part Iâ€™ll never forget about Helgaâ€™s story. For 2 hours she sat and wept while thousands walked to and fro in the airport. Helga looked at me and said, â€œHouston, not a single person stopped and asked if I was okay that day. Not one person.Â It was that day that I realized how much we need each other. It was that day I realized that kindness isnâ€™t normal.â€ Kindness isn't normal. That has stuck with me all these years, especially now that I work in schools nationwide speaking about compassion, kindness, empathy, and love. Iâ€™m reminded all the time that, for many of us (especially young people - but certainly not exclusively), Kindness is NOT usually our default setting. We spend so much time worrying about our problems, our lives, our comfort, our insecurities, and getting to our flightÂ that we walk by or ignore people in need of kindness every day. Iâ€™m oftentimes so worried about ME that Iâ€™m really bad at taking care of YOU. So, Iâ€™ve made it my mission to do my part in making kindness normal, by sharing stories with students, teachers, and parents about our need for character and compassion. I help to provide young people with practical ways to exercise kindness, because they donâ€™t always know what it looks like!Â  And, for me? Iâ€™m always on the lookout for Helgas; I look for the little opportunities that surround me every day to practice making kindness my default setting.

About 7 years ago, my mom broke her hip and had to go to a skilled nursing facility. I visit the facility every day to take care of her after work. Eventually, this time developed into caring for more than just my mom. I now make it a daily act of love and kindness to stop by each room on my mom's hall and other halls to stop and chat or just wave and speak to each person. Sometimes I leave a little treat or just a simple hug. Sometimes I am the only person that reaches out to some of the folks. I have people say they wait on my daily short visit. This is my act of kindness, not just one special day but every day. $no
About a month ago I was having a really tough time after a traumatic event in my life. I became overwhelmed and started to cry on the subway train. A stranger next to me saw my struggle and said simply, "Itâ€™s going to be okay," while handing me a tissue. That unsolicited gesture changed my day and I felt compelled to do the same for others as often as possible. Iâ€™m a hugger and so it seemed fitting to offer hugs to anyone who happened to need them on any given day. At first, I thought I would pop up randomly at different locations but then I just started carrying a â€œFree Hugsâ€ sign everywhere I went. My heart is so warmed by the genuine gratitude I receive, by the skeptics that end up hugging me anyway, and by the people that say that the moment we shared was the best part of their day. There is no greater way to cultivate love than to give it freely. I brought my children along with me today and now they want to do it with me regularly! My hope is that more and more people are inspired to do the same. $no

After a long college road trip, my mom was exhausted when we came home and she usually prepares dinner everyday. So I took it upon myself to prepare dinner for the whole family and give my mom a day off. I looked in the pantry and saw tomato sauce and pasta. Immediately I knew what I was going to make. It took about an hour to make everything, but it was worth seeing the reactions. My mom, dad, and sister were all pleasantly surprised.  $no
After an interesting educational music tour of Cuba, my husband and I ended up 'stuck' when winter storms canceled our flight home to Boston. Everyone returning to the Northeast began scrambling to find alternate routes home. We tried to rebook via the internet, but our phone service did not work in Cuba and wifi availability at our hotel was poor. My husband finally found an alternate flight to Florida, but when he got to the payment page, his American credit card was not accepted. American credit and debit cards cannot be processed in Cuba. We had limited cash and could not get a flight to Boston until Wednesday. Our remaining Cuban pesos would not last until then. Stuck in Cuba without money, we did not know what we would do! Luckily, a woman from New York also on the tour with her son managed to FaceTime her daughter in Maryland, who not only found and booked our flight to Tampa, but also paid for our tickets!

After my surgery due to appendicitis, I wasn't allowed to go to my trampoline practice until a doctor said it was okay. I was sad that I couldn't go to practice and I couldn't even sleep in my own bed because my mom was scared I would fall off of the ladder to go up; I have bunk beds and sleep on the top bunk. My team sent me flowers in a yellow pot with a smiley face on it and also gave me a get well balloon and a card that said something along the lines of, " We hope you bounce back soon! - The KMC Trampoline Team".

After my wife Jill died in 2016 from a texting-while-driving accident, I was left to navigate raising our 4 children under 10. Making sure my children grow into beautiful kind hearted adults is my greatest goal. My Children are growing up in a digital Social World and I want to help provide them with the best tools possible, but there are no digital tools to create and celebrate kindness. We  created AWESOME a Social Networking Game for Good. â€œMaking it fun to do goodâ€. Users share and create Kindness Challenges and also invite friends to receive points. Users are awarded points when they share the Kindness Challenge to one social platform. The users profile ring changes colors as points accumulate and each level is celebrated with an animated explosion.  It only takes one person to create a ripple effect of Kindness. Let's make the World more Awesome together. $no

After the horrible destruction in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, my family and I drove down and volunteered in three homes. The first home had the entire first floor destroyed. Everything was soaked and moldy;Â Â my two younger brothers and I were tasked with the duty of carrying everything outside to the dump pile. All we had were some gloves, an old wagon, and three plastic medical masks, but we had fun. We took turns riding down the long driveway in the wagon to the pile, and we took turns pushing. We made all of it into a game. After we were done, the lady and her daughter who lived there were able to begin rebuilding. The second house had been completely submerged and we had to use large machines to demolish the house. We did not get to help with that, but we were allowed to babysit the family's five kids. We played in the stream by their home. We found salamanders, built a dam, and played many tag games. The final home that we helped at was quite small and had little damage. This time, we got to use sledgehammers to break out all of the molded walls. We worked for about 3 hours and completed the work at that home. Then, after three days, we went back home. $no
All children deserve a quality education. A few years ago, when I was driving to my  job from my place of residence (a company bus full of workers) , I saw Wayuu children walking to school in the distance. It was raining and the little ones were riding on the donkeys. I was devastated. I promised myself that from what I do, I am a language therapist with a focus on inclusion, differentiation and educational coaching that I had to do something. How can we expect equal employment opportunities if the education is not of good quality? From that day on I have been supporting an ethno-educational centre. I don't live in the sector anymore but thanks to the technologies, I still advise the teachers. I want to do more but the local government doesn't seem to care. I give my work and one step at a time. I have been blessed to see several of these students become professionals. But you can always do more.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) $no
All I was doing that day was selling pastries. College was overwhelming, I missed my family, and I was selling pastries. A couple walked in with smiles and I noticed. I noticed how tightly she held his arm. I imagined each wrinkle on their face as a memory; there were hundreds of beautiful memories. He held her hand and she held his. Then, they asked for a pastry to share. As they slowly decided which delicious dessert they'd like to eat, he looked at me with kind eyes and peaceful demeanor and asked me if I always had sold pastries there. I gave him my story and then he gave me his. I'm not sure what he was thinking, or why it popped into his head, but then it happened. He asked me to sing; any song, but would I sing. Of course, he didn'tÂ knowÂ I had been in Honors Choir for years. The only song that came toÂ mindÂ was "You are My Sunshine," so I sang it out. As I began, he also began, and then his wife began to sing too. There, in the midst of the pastries and several other customers, we sang "You are My Sunshine". What I thought would be embarrassing turned into one of the most precious moments I've ever experienced. His eyes were dripping tears, while customers were overwhelmed with joy. When the song finished he looked at me, took my hand, and smiled the most sunshine filled smile I'd ever seen. He said, "Oh, you don't know how much this means to me." And they walked away, hand in hand. He kissed her forehead before he opened the door. A simple song of kindness; a simple act of good. $yes

And all through the grocery store, people were laughing and shopping, being jolly and bright. When what to my wandering eyes did appear, a gently aged man, looking left, looking right. "What's wrong", I did ask. He looked confused, embarrassed, quite red in the face.  " Let me back up.  Forgot my wallet. Needed ice cream for kids who just ran in the race."  I smiled and said " No need to return that back to on the rack.   Let me pay, oh please. I need a chance to offer a little pay back."  The weekend flew by with parties galore. I never thought twice of the man at the store. Again it was Monday. I was tired and sore. After vacation, work tends to be a real bore.  The week of the 4th, jotted down in my journal. No mention of the man or anything abnormal.  It was later that month that a co-worker reported of a man who came in and left with a dash. Made sure I was there then left in a hurry. Muttering something about " give this to the gal who helped  a forgetful man in need of some cash". I know that acts of kindness are offered without the expectation of receiving anything but the satisfaction of making a difference to somebody in a bright way. I really wanted to tell of this story because his act of kindness meant so much to me.  I never expected anything back. He relentlessly asked for my name or address so he could give me the money back.  What he left was a rolled up, of what appeared to be poster paper.  As I unfurled the roll of poster paper this gentle man had left me, he had spent his time sketching him as a child with a wonderful paragraph describing the details in the sketch and why he had added them.. In the little boy's hand, he had cut out a place to attach the money for the ice cream. He didn't leave a name and I never got his.  I wish I had to thank him. I He will never know that this gift is priceless and will last a great bit longer than his ice cream did. $yes

As all good ideas are born late at night while contemplating life's most difficult questions and coming to new realizations, it's currently 12:55 am. In this moment, you my dear reader are witnessing the beginning of a journey.Â I'm only a junior in high school and I've noticed an alarming lack of general kindness in school. With a noticeable theme of stressÂ placed on the students to perform at high standards throughout all grade levels, sometimes people forget to be kind to one another. I am not exempt from this trend; I've noticed that I have become very self-involved. Focusing on my studies and extra-curricular activities, I rarely find myself smiling at other students in the hallway or simply saying good morning to my first block teacher. It may seem like small insignificant actions, but they could carry more weight than you can imagine, especially when your teacher has a 2-month-old baby and still has to wake up early to teach a class at 7:15 am. So what am I going to do? Well that's a good question.Â I have come up with three promises for myself: 1) I promise to try to do small kind acts each week. Nothing too big or elaborate. A "good morning" here, an "I like your shirt" there, and maybe even a "thank you" when I'm leaving a teacher's classroom. Who knows, I could be in a rebellious mood and ask someone how there day has been or write a letter. KINDNESS TARGET: School. 2) I promise to do something a little bit bigger once a month or, hopefully, every other week. For example, making food for the local fire station or leaving a bunch of positive notes in public places. KINDNESS TARGET: The General Public. 3) I promise to call my grandparents each weekend. There isn't any other reason besides the fact that I have to call my grandparents. KINDNESS TARGET: Personal Life and Family. So here goes nothing. $yes
As I walked to my locker in the morning, I noticed we had a new student. I didn't quite think anything of it and left to sit at the tables as I normally do. At the end of the day, I noticed the new student was having trouble opening his locker. SinceÂ no one was helping him, I asked if he needed help. He said yesÂ so I helped open his locker for him. $no
As soon as the new student of my Musical Theater class walked in i asked her a question that made her laugh. "When you have a bowl of cereal do you take your spoon and tap it in the milk?" I asked her.  She looked at me confused and a big smile formed on her face. I knew that she felt welcomed in our program. $no
At 11 years old I became the target of bullying for the first time. This experience came with long-lasting effects that I hope no one ever has to experience first hand. After confiding in trusted adults, a door opened to a world of kindness of every single adult trying to help in the best way possible. From then on, I vowed to always be intentionally kind in my every actions, prompting me to become a RAKtivist and start my podcast called The Choose Kindness Podcast, where I interview guests to educate all generations on the effects of bullying and why they too should choose kindness forever and always. $no
